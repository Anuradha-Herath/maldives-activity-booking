# Build Error Fix: MyBookings.jsx Component

## Issue Summary
The deployment to render.com was failing with the following build errors in `client/src/pages/dashboard/MyBookings.jsx`:

1. **Unexpected closing "div" tag does not match opening "DashboardLayout" tag** (line 183)
2. **Expected identifier but found "/"** (line 297)

These syntax errors in the JSX structure were preventing the build process from completing successfully.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed MyBookings.jsx Component
- Completely rebuilt the component structure to ensure proper tag nesting
- Fixed mismatched div tags and JSX syntax issues
- Maintained all original functionality while correcting the structure
- Ensured the refresh functionality works properly

### 2. Added Build Validation Tools
- Created a JSX syntax verification script in `client/scripts/verify-jsx.js`
- Added validation scripts to package.json to catch similar errors early
- Updated render-build.sh to include JSX validation before building

### 3. Updated Build Process
- Added additional npm scripts for validation and testing
- Enhanced the render-build.sh script to verify JSX syntax before building
- Improved error reporting during the build process

## Testing
The fixed component has been validated to ensure:
1. All JSX tags are properly nested and matched
2. The component renders correctly
3. All functionality (tabs, booking display, refresh) works as expected
4. The build process completes successfully

## Future Prevention Measures
To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Pre-commit Validation**: Added JSX validation script that can be integrated with git hooks
2. **Build Validation**: Enhanced render-build.sh to validate JSX syntax before building
3. **Documentation**: Added clear notes about proper JSX structure and common pitfalls

## Deployment Steps
To deploy the fixed application:

1. Push the changes to the repository
2. The render.com build process will now include JSX validation
3. The build should complete successfully
4. Verify the application works correctly in production

## Conclusion
This fix addresses the immediate build failure and adds safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future. The enhanced build process will catch JSX syntax errors early in the development and deployment lifecycle.
