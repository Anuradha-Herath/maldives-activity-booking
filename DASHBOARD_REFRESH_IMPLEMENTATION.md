# Dashboard Refresh Implementation Details

## Overview

This document provides technical details on the implementation of the dashboard refresh functionality in the Maldives Activity Booking application. The implementation is designed to work reliably in both development and production environments.

## Core Components

### 1. BookingEventEmitter (src/utils/BookingEventEmitter.js)

A singleton event emitter that enables real-time communication between components without requiring prop drilling or complex state management.

```jsx
// Usage example
import bookingEvents from '../utils/BookingEventEmitter';

// To emit an event
bookingEvents.emit('booking_created', bookingData);

// To listen for an event
const unsubscribe = bookingEvents.on('booking_created', (data) => {
  // Handle the booking data
});
```

The event emitter stores events in localStorage to support cross-tab communication and uses a subscription model for within-application communication.

### 2. Multi-Source Data Refresh (src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx)

The Dashboard component listens for data changes from multiple sources:

1. **Context API**: Uses `refreshTrigger` from DashboardContext
2. **URL Parameters**: Detects `?refresh=timestamp` in URL
3. **Event Emitter**: Listens for `booking_created` events
4. **LocalStorage**: Checks for various flags like `new_booking_created`
5. **Prefetched Data**: Uses data that was prefetched during booking process

### 3. Cache-Busting Service Worker (public/cache-buster-sw.js)

A service worker that intercepts API requests in production and adds cache-busting headers to ensure fresh data:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/v1/')) {
    // Clone and modify request to prevent caching
    const noCacheRequest = new Request(event.request.url, {
      // Add headers that prevent caching
      headers: { 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache', ... }
    });
    
    // Use the modified request
    event.respondWith(fetch(noCacheRequest));
  }
});
```

### 4. Hard Navigation with Prefetching (src/pages/BookingRequest.jsx)

When a booking is completed, we:

1. Prefetch dashboard data before navigation
2. Store the data in localStorage
3. Set various flags to indicate a new booking was created
4. Use `window.location.href` with a timestamp parameter instead of React Router navigation

## Implementation Flow

1. **Booking Creation**:
   - User completes booking form
   - API request creates booking
   - BookingEventEmitter emits 'booking_created' event
   - Dashboard data is prefetched and stored in localStorage
   - Various flags are set in localStorage
   - Hard navigation to Dashboard with refresh parameter

2. **Dashboard Loading**:
   - Checks URL for refresh parameter
   - Checks localStorage for flags and prefetched data
   - Listens for events from BookingEventEmitter
   - Updates UI immediately with prefetched data if available
   - Makes API call with cache-busting to verify data freshness

3. **MyBookings Loading**:
   - Checks for new booking flags
   - Listens for events from BookingEventEmitter
   - Makes API call with cache-busting to get latest bookings

## Production-Specific Features

1. **Service Worker Registration**: Only in production builds
2. **Cache Control Headers**: Added to deployment files
3. **Multi-Storage Strategy**: Using both localStorage and sessionStorage
4. **Hard Navigation**: Bypassing React Router when coming from booking page
5. **URL Parameters**: Adding timestamp-based parameters to force fresh data

## Troubleshooting

If dashboard updates still don't appear:

1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify service worker is registered (in production)
3. Check localStorage for expected flags after booking creation
4. Try manually refreshing with the dedicated refresh button
5. Clear browser cache and try again

## Testing

The implementation includes several test utilities:

1. `test-dashboard-fix.js`: Verifies event emission and storage functionality
2. `verify-dashboard-fix.ps1`: Checks implementation completeness
3. Manual testing steps in both development and production environments

## Future Improvements

1. Add WebSocket integration for real-time updates
2. Implement Redux or a more comprehensive state management solution
3. Add offline support with IndexedDB for data persistence
4. Create automated tests for the dashboard refresh flow
