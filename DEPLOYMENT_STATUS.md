# Deployment Status and Next Steps

## Current Status

We're implementing a temporary fix while working on a more permanent solution:

### 🔄 Temporary Solution
- **Frontend**: Using old routes without `/api/v1` prefix
- **Backend**: Currently serving routes without `/api/v1` prefix

### 🎯 Target Solution
- **Frontend**: Using new routes with `/api/v1` prefix
- **Backend**: Serving routes with `/api/v1` prefix

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Fixed duplicate express import in server.js
2. ✅ Added `/api/v1` prefix to all backend route definitions in server.js
3. ✅ Updated frontend configuration to use `/api/v1` prefix
4. ⚠️ Temporarily reverted frontend configuration to use old routes until backend deployment is complete

## Current Issues

- The backend service on Render is not yet serving the updated routes with `/api/v1` prefix
- This could be due to:
  - Deployment not being triggered automatically
  - Failed deployment
  - Long deployment queue (Render free tier)

## Next Steps

### 1. Check Render Dashboard
- Log into Render dashboard
- Check the backend service deployment status
- Look for any errors in the deployment logs

### 2. Manual Deployment
- If needed, trigger a manual deployment on Render:
  - Go to the backend service page
  - Click on "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"

### 3. Verify Backend API
- Once deployment completes, test the backend API:
  - Use the deployment-watcher.js script to check if `/api/v1/activities` is accessible
  - Or visit https://maldives-activity-booking-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/activities directly

### 4. Update Frontend (When Backend is Ready)
- Once backend is serving the `/api/v1` routes:
  - Revert the temporary changes made to frontend configuration
  - Update client/.env.production to use VITE_API_URL=https://maldives-activity-booking-backend.onrender.com/api/v1
  - Update client/vite.config.js proxy to use '/api/v1'
  - Redeploy the frontend

### 5. Final Verification
- Test the frontend at https://maldives-activity-booking-frontend.onrender.com
- Verify that activities are loading correctly
- Check the browser console for any API errors

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify CORS configuration allows the frontend origin
3. Check that the backend service is not in "sleeping" state (Render free tier services sleep after inactivity)
4. Ensure environment variables are set correctly on Render
5. Use the diagnostic scripts provided to identify specific issues:
   - endpoint-diagnostic.js: Checks which API endpoints are accessible
   - deployment-watcher.js: Monitors for deployment completion
   - wake-backend.js: Attempts to wake up the backend service
