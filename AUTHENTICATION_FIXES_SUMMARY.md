# Authentication Flow Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix authentication issues in the Maldives Activity Booking application, particularly focusing on the signup and login processes that were not working correctly in deployment.

## Overview of Issues

The authentication issues in the deployment were caused by several factors:

1. **Environment Variable Format Problems**: The `VITE_API_URL` was not being handled correctly in production
2. **CORS Configuration Issues**: Cross-origin requests were not properly configured
3. **Cookie Settings Issues**: Cookie settings were not compatible with cross-origin authentication
4. **Token Management**: Inconsistent approaches to token storage and retrieval
5. **Error Handling Limitations**: Poor error diagnostics made issues hard to debug

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Token Management

Created a dedicated `tokenManager.js` utility to centralize and standardize token handling:
- Consistent methods for storing, retrieving, and validating tokens
- Better error handling for localStorage operations
- Token format validation to catch corrupted tokens

### 2. Improved Authentication Service

Enhanced `authService.js` with:
- More robust API URL handling for malformed environment variables
- Enhanced error logging for better deployment issue diagnosis
- Improved axios interceptors for consistent authentication
- Better error handling during network failures

### 3. Authentication Context Improvements

Updated `AuthContext.jsx` to:
- Use the new tokenManager for reliable token operations
- Improve session management and persistence
- Enhanced login/logout flows with better error handling
- More robust user session validation

### 4. Server-Side Enhancements

Improved backend authentication with:
- Better CORS configuration to handle cross-origin requests properly
- Enhanced cookie settings with appropriate sameSite and secure attributes
- Detailed logging for authentication processes
- Additional diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting

### 5. Signup Component Fixes

Updated the Signup component to:
- Better handle redirection after successful registration
- Verify authentication state before navigation
- Implement retry mechanisms for unreliable connections
- Provide better error feedback to users

### 6. Proactive Diagnostics

Added new diagnostic tools:
- `authDiagnostic.js` utility for detecting and fixing authentication issues
- `wakeUpBackend.js` to handle sleeping backend servers (common in free deployment tiers)
- `AuthMonitor` component to detect and resolve authentication issues in real-time
- `useAuthMonitor` hook for components to monitor authentication state

### 7. App Initialization Improvements

Enhanced application initialization with:
- Backend wake-up calls during startup
- API connectivity tests to warn about potential issues
- Error monitoring for authentication inconsistencies

## Key Files Modified

1. `client/src/utils/tokenManager.js` (new)
2. `client/src/utils/authDiagnostic.js` (new)
3. `client/src/utils/wakeUpBackend.js` (new)
4. `client/src/utils/useAuthMonitor.js` (new)
5. `client/src/components/auth/AuthMonitor.jsx` (new)
6. `client/src/services/authService.js` (updated)
7. `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` (updated)
8. `client/src/pages/auth/Signup.jsx` (updated)
9. `client/src/main.jsx` (updated)
10. `client/src/App.jsx` (updated)
11. `server/controllers/auth.controller.js` (updated)
12. `server/server.js` (updated)

## Testing Tools

Created various testing utilities to verify the fixes:
- `comprehensive-auth-test.js`: Node.js script for testing the complete authentication flow
- `test-auth-flow.ps1`: PowerShell script to run the comprehensive authentication test
- `client/public/auth-test.html`: Browser-based testing tool for authentication

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying this application, ensure:

1. Environment variables are correctly set (especially `VITE_API_URL`)
2. CORS settings include all frontend origins
3. The backend server is configured with appropriate cookie settings
4. JWT settings (secret and expiration) are properly configured

## Conclusion

The authentication flow has been significantly improved with better error handling, proactive diagnostics, and enhanced resiliency. Users should now be able to sign up and log in without issues, with the application gracefully handling connection problems and other edge cases that might occur in deployment.
