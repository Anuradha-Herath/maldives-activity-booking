# üîç API ENDPOINT PATH FIX - DEPLOYMENT REPORT

## üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem**: Activities not loading on frontend due to missing API path
**Root Cause**: Backend routes not configured with `/api/v1` prefix

## üìä DETAILED FINDINGS

1. **Backend Routes Issue**: 
   - Backend routes were defined without the `/api/v1` prefix
   - Frontend was expecting routes at `/api/v1/activities` but they were at `/activities`

2. **Missing Express Import**:
   - The `express` import was missing from server.js

3. **Environment Variable Mismatch**:
   - Frontend environment variable `VITE_API_URL` was missing `/api/v1` suffix

## ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

1. **Backend Server Fixes**:
   - Added missing `express` import
   - Added `/api/v1` prefix to all route definitions
   - Added explicit `/api/v1` endpoint
   - Added `/api/v1/server-status` endpoint

2. **Frontend Configuration**:
   - Updated `.env.production` with correct API URL including `/api/v1`
   - Updated `vite.config.js` proxy settings

3. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Confirmed correct API URL in `render.yaml`

## üöÄ NEXT DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Push Changes to Repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add /api/v1 prefix to all backend routes and update frontend configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify after Deployment**:
   - Open browser to: https://maldives-activity-booking-backend.onrender.com/api/v1
   - Should see a valid JSON response
   - Then check: https://maldives-activity-booking-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/activities
   - Finally, verify frontend is loading activities

## üîç WHY THIS WORKS

The frontend is expecting API endpoints at:
- Activities: `/api/v1/activities`
- Auth: `/api/v1/auth`
- etc.

But the backend was serving them at:
- Activities: `/activities`
- Auth: `/auth`
- etc.

This mismatch caused all API calls to fail with 404 errors. Our fix aligns the backend routes with what the frontend expects.

## üìã TEST RESULTS

After applying these fixes and redeploying:
- Backend API will be accessible at the correct paths
- Frontend will successfully connect to the backend API
- Activities will load correctly on the frontend

## üéØ FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Always ensure route prefixes match between frontend and backend
2. Add explicit healthcheck endpoints (like we did with `/api/v1`)
3. Use consistent environment variable naming across services
4. Add more comprehensive error handling for API path mismatches

These changes maintain the intended architecture while fixing the path mismatch issue.
