# Dashboard Refresh Fix for Production

## Problem Overview

The dashboard in the Maldives Activity Booking system was not updating properly after a user made a booking in the production environment. Specifically:

- Users created bookings, but the dashboard "Pending Bookings" counter and "Recent Bookings" list didn't update
- The dashboard data remained stale until a manual page refresh was performed
- This issue was particularly prevalent in the production environment

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Navigation Issue**: The app was navigating away from the booking page too quickly, before the refresh mechanism could complete
2. **Caching Issues**: API responses were being cached in the production environment
3. **Trigger Mechanism**: The refresh trigger mechanism was not persisting between page navigations
4. **Delayed Backend Synchronization**: In production, there may be delays between write operations and read availability

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced DashboardContext

- Added localStorage persistence for refresh trigger state
- Implemented timestamp-based refreshing alongside counter-based refreshes
- Added logging for debugging production issues

### 2. Improved Navigation Flow

- Added a small delay before navigation from BookingRequest to ensure the refresh trigger is properly set
- Changed navigation target from homepage to dashboard for better user experience
- Added a check for dashboard refresh on arrival from other pages

### 3. API Cache-Busting

- Modified all API calls to include timestamp-based cache-busting parameters
- Ensures fresh data is always retrieved from the server
- Prevents browser or CDN caching of API responses

### 4. Production-Specific Enhancements

- Added special handling for production environment with localStorage flags
- Implemented multiple refresh mechanisms to ensure at least one works in production
- Added visual feedback with last-updated timestamp and manual refresh button

## Testing

The fix has been tested in both development and production environments:

1. **Local Development**: Fully tested with fast refresh timing
2. **Production Simulation**: Tested with artificial delays to simulate production conditions
3. **Production Deployment**: Deployed to production for verification in the actual environment

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. Visit the dashboard to see current stats
2. Create a new booking for any activity
3. After booking completion, you should be directed to the dashboard
4. Verify the dashboard stats and recent bookings have updated

## Monitoring

We recommend monitoring the following:

- Check browser console for any refresh-related error messages
- Monitor API response times for dashboard statistics endpoint
- Ensure localStorage is functioning properly in the production environment

If issues persist, check the browser's network tab to ensure API responses aren't being cached.
