# Build Fix: MyBookings.jsx Component

## Issue
The build was failing due to syntax errors in the MyBookings.jsx file. The errors were:
1. Unexpected closing "div" tag that did not match opening "DashboardLayout" tag (line 183)
2. Expected identifier but found "/" (line 297)

## Fix
The component had mismatched closing tags which were causing the build to fail. The main issues were:

1. Extra closing divs that were not properly matched with opening tags
2. Malformed JSX structure causing parse errors

## Changes Made
1. Completely restructured the MyBookings.jsx file to ensure proper tag nesting
2. Fixed the error related to the refresh button functionality
3. Ensured that all tags are properly closed in the correct order
4. Maintained all the original functionality while fixing the syntax errors

## Testing
The component should now build successfully without any syntax errors. The user dashboard should display bookings properly after making a booking request.

## Additional Notes
This fix will allow the application to be built and deployed successfully on render.com. The original functionality for displaying and managing bookings remains unchanged.
